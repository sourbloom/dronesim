To do / Ideas
===

High Priority
 * Easy way to draw lines between drones.

Low Priority
 * De/acceleration for drone movement.
   - Would make it more of a challenge/more realistic.

 * Proper class structure for Drone class.
   - Things like x and y coordinates should be untouchable by subclasses.
   - Things that are marked for the user to control should be public.
   - Would help distinguish what's available for you to "use".

 * Re-write in lisp ;)
